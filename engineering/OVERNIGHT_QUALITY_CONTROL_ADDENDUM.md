# Overnight Quality Control Addendum — through 2026-09-06 18:17 CT

Canonical shadow-audit continuation. Read with `engineering/OVERNIGHT_QUALITY_CONTROL.md`.

## LIVE STATE
- `origin/main`: `6a045e50a33408ecafdfa21c9ff951d731347bd9` — freshly reverified unchanged.
- Claude Writer V2.1 base: `claude/writer-v2-traceability-repair-01` @ `2256f229be0c5b245cb5c1a2ec7cd4b0d8b3c2e6` — unchanged.
- SuperChad takeover: `superchad/writer-v2-semantic-failclosed-01` @ `5669d2d3f7d3a0865ba69d6cc42aa0fa3d09c3d5` — unchanged.
- Quality stack: `superchad/quality-stack-integration-01` @ `8d93f4e71489674f4bc95aade72f9c411620d30b` — unchanged.
- Mission 1A: `claude/p0-manifest-semantic-merge-01` @ `04ef8a3f6f23ff1aaef22482c89767612494f9ab` — unchanged; PR #57 remains open/draft against `main`, explicitly `DO NOT MERGE`, while its body identifies the Claude Writer branch as base authority.
- Mission 1B: `superchad/mission-1b-branch-recon-hardening-01` @ `4e014946cf106d9d3457259c481f10ebfb8dbd41` — unchanged; PR #58 remains open/draft against `main` and `DO NOT MERGE`.
- Combined integration-cert: `superchad/mission-1ab-integration-cert-02` @ `c46532af91bb55696b4cfafc7a7ece38cf3b99ae` — unchanged; PR #60 remains open/draft against `main` and `DO NOT MERGE`.
- Audit/control branch before this write: `superchad/overnight-quality-control-01` @ `0abc6a2864242fa79b5264463a1838f5ec761ab9`.
- Main remains untouched. No merge/deploy/publish/render/provider-backed generation was observed in this audit window.

## AUTHORIZED ROADMAP SLICE
The last durable checkpoint remains authoritative:
1. reconcile whether Mission 1B/integration certification was explicitly authorized before the Mission 1A review gate;
2. independently review the existing Mission 1A / Mission 1B / combined certification surfaces as evidence only;
3. correct or close stale Mission 1A PR topology;
4. do not advance to live Writer/provider testing, promotion, render, deploy, publish, or another implementation slice until governance/review state is reconciled.

## DELTA SINCE 17:18 CT
No relevant application-code branch head, main SHA, Mission 1A/Mission 1B/combined-cert PR state, or combined-cert head changed during this audit window.

Fresh verification confirms:
- `main` remains `6a045e50...`;
- Claude Writer base remains `2256f229...`;
- SuperChad takeover remains `5669d2d3...`;
- quality stack remains `8d93f4e...`;
- Mission 1A remains `04ef8a3f...`;
- Mission 1B remains `4e014946...`;
- combined certification remains `c46532af...`;
- PR #57 remains draft/open against `main`, head `04ef8a3f...`, 34 changed files, 87 commits;
- PR #58 remains draft/open against `main`, head `4e014946...`, 3 changed files, 7 commits;
- PR #60 remains draft/open against `main`, head `c46532af...`, 37 changed files, 91 commits.

No new exact-head CI was required because no relevant implementation head moved. Existing green exact-head evidence remains technical evidence only, not authorization.

## CURRENT WARNINGS
### STOP WARNING — GOVERNANCE / REVIEW TOPOLOGY STILL OPEN
Unchanged. Mission 1B and combined certification exist and were technically green from prior evidence, but the recorded Mission 1A authorization/review gate was not formally closed first. The stale Mission 1A direct-to-main review topology remains the known governance defect until explicitly corrected or closed.

Do not treat branch existence, draft PRs, synthetic integration surfaces, or green CI as authorization to merge or advance.

### CONVERGENCE STATUS
WARNING — unchanged.

### ROADMAP STATUS
DRIFTING / BLOCKED — unchanged pending explicit reconciliation of authorization and review topology.

## SECURITY
Main still points at commit `6a045e50...`, whose generic `branch_recon.yml` design checks out arbitrary refs/scripts with GROQ_API_KEY/GEMINI_API_KEY available. Mission 1B contains the hardened zero-secret alternative, but the default-branch runner remains unintegrated.

Until explicitly authorized integration lands, do not use main's generic branch runner for secret-backed arbitrary branch diagnostics.

## CORRECTNESS / PROVENANCE
No new correctness regression, test weakening, provenance loss, raw file-copy integration, accidental publish/render enablement, or production mutation was observed in this window. Existing Mission 1A correctness evidence and Mission 1B/integration security evidence remain the latest technical evidence.

The PR topology remains materially asymmetric: PR #57 presents the inherited Writer stack plus Mission 1A as a 34-file/87-commit direct-to-main surface even though its own declared base authority is the Claude Writer branch; PR #58 remains the narrow 3-file Mission 1B surface; PR #60 remains the deliberately synthetic 37-file combined certification surface. This is review evidence, not an approved integration plan.

## CREATIVE QUALITY
No new live scripts or renders were observed, so there is no new evidence on hook quality, first-8-second escalation, spoken naturalness, information gain, visual specificity, payoff, sound/pacing, AI smell, or postability. Writer promotion remains unearned.

## NEXT AUTHORIZED ACTION
1. Resolve the authorization/sequencing discrepancy explicitly.
2. Independently review the existing combined surface and narrow Mission 1B surface as evidence only.
3. Correct/close stale PR #57 topology so it cannot be mistaken for an approved direct-to-main integration candidate.
4. Do not begin another implementation slice or provider-backed/live Writer work until the governance gate is cleared.

## APPROVAL / SPEND
- Jacob remains final integration authority.
- No main merge/deploy/publish/render authorized.
- No material spend authorized.
- Mission 1A, Mission 1B, and combined integration remain unapproved for merge.
