# Overnight Quality Control Addendum — through 2026-09-06 12:19 CT

Canonical shadow-audit continuation. Read with `engineering/OVERNIGHT_QUALITY_CONTROL.md`.

## LIVE STATE
- `origin/main`: `6a045e50a33408ecafdfa21c9ff951d731347bd9` — freshly reverified unchanged.
- Claude Writer V2.1 base: `claude/writer-v2-traceability-repair-01` @ `2256f229be0c5b245cb5c1a2ec7cd4b0d8b3c2e6` — unchanged from prior checkpoint.
- SuperChad takeover: `superchad/writer-v2-semantic-failclosed-01` @ `5669d2d3f7d3a0865ba69d6cc42aa0fa3d09c3d5` — unchanged from prior checkpoint.
- Quality stack: `superchad/quality-stack-integration-01` @ `8d93f4e71489674f4bc95aade72f9c411620d30b` — unchanged from prior checkpoint.
- Mission 1A: `claude/p0-manifest-semantic-merge-01` @ `04ef8a3f6f23ff1aaef22482c89767612494f9ab` — freshly reverified unchanged; PR #57 remains open/draft against `main`.
- Mission 1B: `superchad/mission-1b-branch-recon-hardening-01` @ `4e014946cf106d9d3457259c481f10ebfb8dbd41` — freshly reverified unchanged; PR #58 remains open/draft against `main`.
- Combined integration-cert: `superchad/mission-1ab-integration-cert-02` @ `c46532af91bb55696b4cfafc7a7ece38cf3b99ae` — freshly reverified unchanged.
- PR #57 still says `DO NOT MERGE` and identifies the Claude Writer branch as base authority while targeting `main`.
- Main remains untouched. No merge/deploy/publish/render/provider-backed generation observed in this audit window.

## AUTHORIZED ROADMAP SLICE
The last durable checkpoint remains authoritative:
1. reconcile whether Mission 1B/integration certification was explicitly authorized before the Mission 1A review gate;
2. independently review the existing Mission 1A / Mission 1B / combined certification surfaces as evidence only;
3. correct or close stale Mission 1A PR topology;
4. do not advance to live Writer/provider testing, promotion, render, deploy, publish, or another implementation slice until governance/review state is reconciled.

## DELTA SINCE 11:16 CT
No relevant application-code branch head, main SHA, or Mission 1A/Mission 1B PR state changed during this audit window.

Freshly reverified from current repository/PR state:
- `main` remains `6a045e50...`;
- Mission 1A remains `04ef8a3f...`;
- Mission 1B remains `4e014946...`;
- combined certification remains `c46532af...`;
- PR #57 remains draft/open against `main`;
- PR #58 remains draft/open against `main`.

No new exact-head CI was required because no relevant implementation head moved. Existing green exact-head evidence remains technical evidence only, not authorization.

## CURRENT WARNINGS
### STOP WARNING — GOVERNANCE / REVIEW TOPOLOGY STILL OPEN
Unchanged. Mission 1B and combined certification exist and were technically green from prior evidence, but the recorded Mission 1A authorization/review gate was not formally closed first. The stale Mission 1A direct-to-main review topology remains the known governance defect until explicitly corrected or closed.

Do not treat branch existence, draft PRs, synthetic integration surfaces, or green CI as authorization to merge or advance.

### CONVERGENCE STATUS
WARNING — unchanged.

### ROADMAP STATUS
DRIFTING / BLOCKED — unchanged pending explicit reconciliation of authorization and review topology.

## SECURITY
Main still points at commit `6a045e50...`, whose current design describes the generic `branch_recon.yml` as checking out arbitrary refs/scripts with GROQ_API_KEY/GEMINI_API_KEY available. Mission 1B contains the hardened zero-secret alternative, but the default-branch runner remains unintegrated.

Until explicitly authorized integration lands, do not use main's generic branch runner for secret-backed arbitrary branch diagnostics.

## CORRECTNESS / PROVENANCE
No new correctness regression, test weakening, provenance loss, raw file-copy integration, accidental publish/render enablement, or production mutation was observed in this window. Existing Mission 1A correctness evidence and Mission 1B/integration security evidence remain the latest technical evidence.

## CREATIVE QUALITY
No new live scripts or renders were observed, so there is no new evidence on hook quality, first-8-second escalation, spoken naturalness, information gain, visual specificity, payoff, sound/pacing, AI smell, or postability. Writer promotion remains unearned.

## NEXT AUTHORIZED ACTION
1. Resolve the authorization/sequencing discrepancy explicitly.
2. Independently review the existing combined surface and narrow Mission 1B surface as evidence only.
3. Correct/close stale PR #57 topology so it cannot be mistaken for an approved direct-to-main integration candidate.
4. Do not begin another implementation slice or provider-backed/live Writer work until the governance gate is cleared.

## APPROVAL / SPEND
- Jacob remains final integration authority.
- No main merge/deploy/publish/render authorized.
- No material spend authorized.
- Mission 1A, Mission 1B, and combined integration remain unapproved for merge.
